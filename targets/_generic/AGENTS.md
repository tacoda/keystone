## Keystone harness

This project uses a **keystone harness**. The harness at [`harness/`](harness/) defines the engineering knowledge, rules, sensors, and self-update flywheels you operate within.

**Read first:**
- [`harness/README.md`](harness/README.md) — five components (corpus, guides, sensors, policies, flywheels), the lifecycle, and the iron laws.
- [`harness/adapters/_generic/`](harness/adapters/_generic/) — fallback bindings used when no agent-specific adapter exists.
- [`harness/corpus/domain/`](harness/corpus/domain/) — business rules for this project.

**Lifecycle actions:** `spec` · `orient` · `check-drift` · `verify` · `review` · `learn` (plus `bootstrap`, `audit`, `synthesize`, `mode`). Invoke by asking in natural language; read the matching `harness/guides/process/<phase>.md` for each action — see [`harness/adapters/_generic/lifecycle.md`](harness/adapters/_generic/lifecycle.md).

**Iron laws** — non-negotiable across every phase:

- No proceeding without explicit acceptance criteria in the spec.
- No completion claims without fresh verification evidence — sensors must have run this turn.
- No commits with failing sensors. Never `--no-verify`.
- No AI attribution in commits, PRs, or tracker comments.
- No silent overwrites of state files.
